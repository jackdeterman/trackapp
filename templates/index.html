        <h4>Weekly Update</h4>
        <div class="col-12 d-flex mb-3">
            With the Northeast Invitational and final regular-season MVC meet wrapped up, let’s take a rewind of the week’s festivities. On the boys’ side, there were huge performances across the board in both meets. As the coaches know (and remind us constantly), the competitive indoor season doesn’t really start until January, and this week proved it. At the MVC regular-season championship meet on Wednesday, 21 of the 40 male athletes who competed PR’d in their respective event. This included 4 of the 6 athletes competing in the 300m dash and the 1000m dash, as well as junior sprinter and jumper Jimmy Nguyen’s breakout 7.27 seconds in the 55m dash. After a gut-wrenching meet, senior Andrey Sorokin sealed the win in the 2-mile, taking the 5 points against Central’s top runner in a time of 10:21.72. The 4x4 relay was simply icing on the cake. The women performed even better than the men in the PRs department, with 30 PRs out of the 42 athletes who competed in the meet. Megan Rozzi PRd in both the 300m dash and the high jump with performances of 45.53 and 4’06”, respectively, a massive step in the right direction for the young athlete. Additionally, last year’s star pentathlete Olivia Siwicki PR’d in the Long Jump in 14’11” to go along with her impressive 400 split of just 62 seconds. Sadly, the women lost to a very strong Central Catholic team, falling just short of the MVC regular-season title. They will be back with a vengeance on February 10th to claim the MVC Championship.

            Later in the week at the Northeast Invitational, the boys and girls had yet another impressive showing, displaying growing improvement and momentum leading into the coveted state relay championship on Sunday, January 23. James Allard capped off a strong week with two 55-second performances in the 400m, one in a relay, and one in the open 400. This came after his 1:30 600m performance on Wednesday. All eyes are on the junior mid-distance runner to see if his impressive progression will continue in such a promising direction. Alongside Allard, 17 boys milers took to the track on Friday, with 12 PRs including an impressive sub-5 performance from sophomore distance runner Ben Katsev. On Saturday, the boys’ 4x800 meter relay took down the school record with a meet-winning time of 7:57.82. The girls had similarly impressive performances during the three-day invitational as well. Leyla Kvaternik posted her first sub-3:10 1000m time of the season in 3:09.91 before coming back for a mixed relay on the final day of the invitational. Additionally, three women took advantage of the opportunity to try the triple jump during the indoor season, including Joy Muiriri, Alexis Schlesinger, and Brenna O’ Brien. All three of these athletes posted indoor PRs in the event.

            With a long week of competition coming to an end, it’s time to press the reset button for the team. With as much progress has been made in recent meets, there is still much work to be done before the State Relay competition on Sunday. Editors’ Prediction? A win for the girls and the boys’ teams. Another unanimous decision.

        <h4>Previous Updates</h4>
        <div class="col-12 d-flex mb-1">
            Week 1 of meets are in the book for the North Andover Track Team, with lots of exciting results to report! Between the meet hosted by our team at the high school,
            the MSTCA Winter Festival and the MSTCA Speed Classic, the boys and girls teams combined for 241 PRs. You read that correctly. 241 PRs.
            Staggering performances from everyone, especially for the season being in its infancy. On the boys side, Aiden Butterfield kicked off the season with a massive PR
            in the mile, clocking a time of 5:38.33. This comes after a breakthrough cross country season for the runner, in which he continued his high school story of improving in leaps and bounds,
            and eventually finished the season with a PR just short of 19 minutes over 5k. In addition to Aiden, Jake Ottaviani also clocked a PR in his first mile of the season,
            while Jared Simoneau opened his 600m account for the year with a time of 1:37.66, PRing by over 6 seconds. On the women's side of things, Casey Goland continued her astounding start to the season
            clocking a PR of 9.29 in the 55m hurdles, qualifying for states along the way. This race comes after Goland's dominating win in the prior week's MSTCA Winterfest meet. She said in a statement "I'm faster than Sydney McLaughlin.
            And you can't prove I'm not." Wise words, Casey, and who can argue with her with the way she's started the season? In other results, long jumper and sprinter Ceci Ginsburg continues to impress,
            competing in the MSTCA Winterfest and MSTCA Speed Classic and clocking an impressive time of 7.94 in the 55m. Incredible stuff from the women's already dominant young core of athletes. And an immeasurably promising start to
            the season from both teams.

            With the first MVC meet approaching, let's take a preview of the Editor's Predictions here at Jack's Track App. After a quick poll consisting of 1 person talking out loud to himself, the results are in: Boys and Girls teams run away
            with the meet (literally and figuratively). With the versatility and depth both rosters have, the editors here at Jack's Track App can't see anything other than dominant victories on both sides of the team happening.
            "Too weak, too slow," as Magnus Carlson would say. But we don't play chess here. We run. So, "Start fast, finish faster," as someone I'm too lazy to Google would say. Enjoy the meet!
